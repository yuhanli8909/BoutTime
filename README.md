# BoutTime
TreeHouse Project created in Swift.
Specifically, the game involves users taking historical events and seeing if they can put them in the correct chronological order. 
A single round of play consists of ordering four random events, and there are six rounds in each full game.
You will not only write the code to build the user interface, youâ€™ll also decide what kind of events to quiz the user about.
